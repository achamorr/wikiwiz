A chrome extension for wikipedia hoverable define.

## Inspiration
For many developers, Wikipedia is our go-to when learning new conceptual information. It allows easy previewing of Wikipedia information on a topic on the-fly. You don't even have to open a new tab, instead it displays an easy hover-able tool tip with the Wikipage abstract and a helpful jpg to go with it.

We thought this useful feature could also save you time even when you're not on Wikipedia, and will let you learn new topics you normally wouldn't bother to open a browser and scroll a webpage for, without changing anything about your workflow.

Take Wikipedia preview with you wherever you browse!

Hover, read, and learn, with our just-in-time Wikipedia extension.

## What it does
It displays Wikipedia information on places, people, and things of your interest in your browser.
